v1.0
   Initial Release.

v1.0.1:
   Compile with GTK versions 1.0.x.

v1.0.2:
   Added undo.  Up to 10 commands can be undone. 
   Trap the Ctrl-c keypress and quit.

v1.0.3:
   Map the ^ key to the x^y function.

v1.0.4
   Handle keys in number pad correctly.
   Fix memory leak in asin and atan of complex numbers.
   Fix malloc/ free errors introduced with the undo feature.

v1.1.0
   Add hex, dec, oct, and bin commands.
   Add rip command.
   Command line args to set font and window size.
   Fix possible memory corruption bug when displaying matrices.

v1.1.1
   Force keyboard entry to be interpreted as a command when
      prefixed with a single or double quote.

v1.1.2
   Add db10 and db20 commands.

v1.1.3
   Added deg, rad, pol and rect commands.

v1.1.4 
   Interpret comma input characters as a points.  This is useful
   since in many countries the number keypad has a comma instead of a
   point. 

v1.1.5 
   Added engineer notation.  Adjust exponents of real numbers to
   multipliers of 3, for example: print 100e-6 instead of 1e-4 .  Only
   applies to exponents >5 or <1.

v1.1.6.1 
   Introduced DECIMAL_ENG mode for engineer notation.  The user
   can now switch between 100e-6 and 1e-4 printout.  DECIMAL mode
   behaves like it did before 1.1.5j.  Shortcut for this is "eng".
   Added "About" menu.  Bugfix: some commands like 'quit' and 'matrix'
   dismissed because a command counter was not updated in button_def.c.
   Fixed.

v1.1.7 
   The complex function can now not only create complex numbers
   but also decompose them. 

v1.1.7.1
   minor change in callback_menu.c to compile also under cygwin.

v1.1.7.2
   Not a bug, but very confusing:
   for ex.: 194870,27-18500 gives "9870.26999999999".
   Remember, you cannot store the decimal number 0.1 exactly in a
   float since there's no way to build 0.1 as a sum of (negative) powers
   of two.
   To avoid output like the above, every real is now displayed with
   a precision of maximum 12 digits.

v1.1.7.3
   Clean up in real.c and real.h (does not change anything):
   Introduce constant    
         #define PRINT_REAL_DIG DBL_DIG-3 // = usually 12 

v1.1.7.4
   New function "mod"=remainder introduced. The remainder of a division 
   operation is the result of subtracting the integral quotient 
   multiplied by the denominator from the numerator

v1.2
   Compiles against gt+-2.0. Locale determines the decimal separator
   point or comma now.

v1.3.0
   This release is based on a merge of the sources 1.1.7.4
   and the debian patches 1.1.2-3. 
   The branch 1.2 is abandoned. 

v1.3.1
   Basemode defaults now to dec like the original version 1.1.2.
   A new command line option -bm dec|eng|bin|oct|hex allows to
   change the default value for basemode.

v1.3.2
   Cntr-c copies the bottom of the stack to the Gnome-clipboard.
   (Cntr-v not implemented yet).
   Complex numbers are displayed with ";" instead of ",".
   "," is decimal separator in some locales.

v1.3.3
   Bugfix: Convert "." button to "," if decimal operator is set
   to comma by locale settings.

v1.3.4
   If compiled with -DUSE_PANGO switch grpn uses the pango font 
   library and Liberation Mono font as default. Can be 
   overwritten with the -fn-disp command line option. 
   Both keys "," and "." are always treated as decimal separator 
   whatever the locale is.

v1.4.0
   New left and right shift operators.
   Some fixes for compilation warnings in regard to the mod 
   operator functions.
   New adds a gitignore file.
